# Mr. Potato Head

This is an exercise that I have adapted for an intro to github workshop. The slides that go along with the workshop are [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VViq17vH401x3aN5MPup1NbhArl-NBV9zFGFS6Hf_8U/edit?usp=sharing). Participants should set up  a github account and have downloaded the desktop program that works with github (https://desktop.github.com/).
